# bootcamp_project
This is the repository code for our bootcamp project.  

The purpose for this project is to showcase what we are learning in this bootcamp.   It can also be used to show potential employers what skills we have learned.  I am very fortunate because I work for a company where we do all of this so I won't have to look far to use my new skillset after completing this course.   

The website is comprised of three webpages.  They are as follows:

index.html -- The About Me or Main Page containing personal information about me.
portfolio.html -- The Portfolio Page containing links to the projects that we have completed.  
contact.html -- The Contact Page containing a form which can be filled out by the user requesting information. 

There is an image folder which contains all of the images used in this website. 

Please enjoy the website!!!!!
